Patient: hello , i have a question to ask you today . [SEP] hi there , sure go ahead . [SEP] can i get sick from people who don ' t have symptoms ?
Reference: there have been instances of transmission before the person became sick or when a person ' s symptoms were so mild that they did not know they were sick . however , it is unclear if this contributes to significant spread of the virus in the population . most people become ill from being in close contact with someone who shows symptoms such as coughing and sneezing , therefore transmitting the virus through droplets .
