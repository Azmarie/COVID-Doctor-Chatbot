[SEP] okay , seems like there are no good news . [SEP] is there anything else i can help today ? [SEP] yes , does home made masks work ? [SEP] a homemade mask or face covering can act as a barrier to help stop tiny droplets from your mouth and nose from entering the air and landing on other people or surfaces around you when you are talking , laughing , yelling , singing , coughing , or sneezing . homemade masks can help to contain these droplets , but they work best if they have three layers and fit closely over your mouth , nose , cheeks and chin . masks are less effective if the shape or the material has gaps in it because it will allow droplets to pass through . [SEP] okay so as long as i wear proper mask , i am safe ? [SEP] if you are sick you should stay home . wearing a mask does not make it okay to go out , but it can help prevent the spread of germs at home if you cannot physically distance . [SEP] okay , what about home made sanitizers ? would that work ? [SEP] no , health canada cautions that people should only use products that are on their approved or interim list of hand sanitizers . serious problems such as burns , poisoning , lung problems and allergic reactions can occur if people use non - approved products . non - approved products may not be effective against covid - 19 and give people a false sense of security . if you can ' t buy hand sanitizer , wash your hands ! washing your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds is the most effective way to reduce the risk of spreading all germs , not just covid - 19 .
